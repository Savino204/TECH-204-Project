This project is a web app that I designed as part of my final piece for my TECH 204 course at Oberlin College and Conservatory.

The web app allows users to record the sounds that surround them by simply holding thier finger on the screen. 
As soon as the user lets go of the screen, the app begins to play back the audio that was just recorded on a loop.

This web app can, being hosted entirely through GitHub Projects, can be deployed through a single QR Code and works locally. 

It was designed to allow users to communicate intuitavly with each other by manipulating thier and thier peers' sonic environment
through the medium of digital audio. 

I designed the app myself, and I programmed it with some assitance from ChatGPT in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
